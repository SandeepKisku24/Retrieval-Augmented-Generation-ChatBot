Bonus shares are additional shares given by the company to existing shareholders, free of cost, in proportion to the shares held by the shareholder.
Shareholders who own shares of the company on the record date set by the company are eligible for bonus shares.
The bonus shares will get credited to your demat account 10-15 days after the record date.In case you do not receive the same post 15 days from the Record date you can check the status with the Registrar (RTA).You can find the details of the Registrar on the BSE India website by visiting the Corp Information section.
The buy price of bonus shares is zero, as they are credited at no cost. When the shares are credited to your account, the quantity of shares increases while the invested value remains unaffected. As a result, the average price of the stock reduces. Be assured that it is correctly calculated by Angel One.
